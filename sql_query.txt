# In this schema, each invoice is guaranteed to have a CustomerId, so an inner join allows us to retrieve the customerâ€™s name associated with each invoice.
#The ReferredBy column in the Customers table refers to another customer within the same table.
#To ensure we list all invoices, even those without a referrer, we use a LEFT JOIN to check for a referring customer and retrieve their name if available.
#This way, invoices without a referrer will still appear in the results, with the ReferrerName shown as NULL.
